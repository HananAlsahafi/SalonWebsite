<p> Many people take their skin for granted. The skin has several basic needs. 
First, it needs to be kept as clean as possible.
Second,it needs to be protected from sunlight and other environmental insults.
The skin of the face needs even more attention than the rest of the body because the face has more oil glands,
especially the central forehead, eye areas, 
nose and chin. One needs to perform a brief morning regimen for the facial skin and a longer regimen before going to bed.
Once you have your skin care regimen down, it will only take five to ten minutes a day.</p>
